# The Raiton Language

A toolchain for the Raiton language.

## Getting started

This implementation was done in Go version 2.21.0, so you will need the `go` tool installed.
This will probably work with some older versions but this is the one I worked with.

After cloning the repository, run `make build` to build the tool. You should get the
`raiton` binary in the `./build` directory.

To get help, run: ```
raiton help
```
